Welcome.</p>\n<p>I hope you’ll check out my photos while you’re here (they’re my favorite). And maybe read some nerdy blog posts when I get around to making them.</p>\n<h2>About me</h2>\n<p>My name is <strong>Matt Foxx Duncan</strong>. I am a full-stack developer by day and a hobbyist photographer when I’m not staring at a screen. Currently I reside in <strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong> where I bicycle way more than drive. Hip-hop, jazz, and electronic sounds in any combination make me smile.</p>\n<p>I work for <strong><a href="https://www.fulfillment.com/">Fulfillment.com</a></strong> as an in-house <strong>Senior Developer</strong> and battle the chaos of package logistics on a daily basis. These days I work primarily with Javascript in <a href="https://reactjs.org">ReactJS</a>/<a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> though I dabble in anything that can interest me and provide a challenging goal.</p>\n<p>On the photography side I use <strong>Canon</strong> gear and shoot everything and anything. I lean towards natural light and landscape photography but the strobes and studio modifiers in my closet do not gather dust. Please reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating! Personal/artistic endeavours will always be pro-bono or close to it. Commercial work is on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’d like thank <a href="https://www.greglobinski.com">greg lobinski</a> for stellar work he did creating the base code for this blog. It’s dynamite and you should buy him a beer.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Yo!"}},footnote:{id:"C:/Users/mattd/Code/portfolio/content/parts/footnote.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",html:'<ul>\n<li>This site is based on gatsby-starter-personal-blog built by <a href="https://www.greglobinski.com">greg lobinski</a></li>\n<li>with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> &#x26; <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a></li>\n<li>photos by me</li>\n</ul>'},site:{siteMetadata:{facebook:{appId:""}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/about/"}}}});
